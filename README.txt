The assignment can be found within the script file VBA Script.bas. 
All script for this assignment was self-generated with no peer, Tutor, or direct instructor assistance. Furthermore, no script was copied from external sources. 
However, parts of the script were repurposed (i.e., copied from other xlsm files with variables and logic adjusted as needed) from previous class assignments in week 2 of the course (i.e., classes 2.1-2.3). 


*Note: I was unsure what all to put in here. So, if I missed the mark, please clarify what I need to include in future assignments.
